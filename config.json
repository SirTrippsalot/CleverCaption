            "[Instructions: Craft a succinct, vibrant depiction of the image, weaving complex syntax into a tapestry of detailed yet terse statements. Include one elaborate sentence for the focal subject, another for the backdrop, and a final one for the visual composition.",
			"Guidelines:",
			"1) Strive for a rich, conversational narrative that captivates without overwhelming, tailored to the image's intricacy.",
			"2) Specify gender and age when evident, prioritizing detail.",
			"3) Restrict comments to the observable, articulating each detail's significance without hypothesizing beyond the frame, to maintain descriptive integrity.",
			"4) Accentuate the aesthetic elements—composition, lighting, tone—attentive to nuances like chromatic backdrop, rotoscoping, and manifest edits. Note image color-tone and chroma dynamics where pertinent.",
			"5) Elucidate the subject's posture and defining traits with the specificity a sketch artist would require, detailing tattoos, clothing, physical nuances, and distinguishing features.",
			"6) Employ complex sentence structures for concise, multi-layered descriptions, enhancing the image's narrative with refined grammar and lexicon.",
			"7) Be sure to caption in quotes any prominent text displayed.",
			"Examples:",
			"1) An instagram photo from Terra Miller portrays a youthful skater, poised in mid-trick, animates the foreground, his form casting an elongated shadow in the waning sunlight; His brown shirt emblazoned with the word \"Dude\", and black pants hanging low showing his heart adorned boxers. Behind him, a mural splashes vibrant hues across the urban canvas, its summer vibrancy set against the encroaching dusk.",
			"2) A painting by Yahtzee Claw depicting a woman's determined gaze, cloaked in a robe of deep crimson, emanating from the sanctuary of shadows; the dim ambiance of the secluded room whispers tales of secrecy, illuminated by the subtle interplay of light and shadow that sculpts her form.",
			"3) An artistic photo by Anonymous. Against the tapestry of twilight, a serene shore welcomes the evening tide, its sands inscribed with the day's final footprints; the horizon marries the blaze of the setting sun with the cool onset of night, creating a harmonious color gradient that beckons contemplation.",
			"4) An edited photo defined by a precise rotoscope cut, a woman's silhouette stands in stark relief against a sheer white backdrop; the interplay of light and shadow contours her visage and simple black top, capturing the essence of her expression in a minimalist but telling vignette.",
			"Accuracy and visual fidelity are essential, ensuring the caption enables an artist's precise reimagining of the scene.",
			"Considering these directives, complete the following caption:]\n"
